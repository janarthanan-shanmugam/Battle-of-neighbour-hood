I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\n- Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\n- Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n\n\nThe procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n- what is the cost of rent (per square ft) around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\n- what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\n- What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future home?\n- What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?\n- How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n- Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n- Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Reference of venues around current residence in Singapore for comparison to Manhattan place"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Shenton Way, District 01, Singapore\naddress = 'Mccallum Street, Singapore'\n\ngeolocator = Nominatim()\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(address)\nlatitude = location.latitude\nlongitude = location.longitude\nprint('The geograpical coordinate of Singapore home are {}, {}.'.format(latitude, longitude))", "execution_count": 21, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "name": "stdout", "text": "The geograpical coordinate of Singapore home are 1.2792655, 103.8480938.\n"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "neighborhood_latitude=1.2792655\nneighborhood_longitude=103.8480938", "execution_count": 22, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# The code was removed by Watson Studio for sharing.", "execution_count": 23, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "\nLIMIT = 100 # limit of number of venues returned by Foursquare API\nradius = 500 # define radius\n\n# create URL\nurl = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(\n    CLIENT_ID, \n    CLIENT_SECRET, \n    VERSION, \n    neighborhood_latitude, \n    neighborhood_longitude, \n    radius, \n    LIMIT)\nurl # display URL", "execution_count": 24, "outputs": [{"execution_count": 24, "metadata": {}, "data": {"text/plain": "'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id=DVCTZDPDYXTS0BRJFPLMHM323APGXNWZI5PLRQ1VC0CFLF1T&client_secret=5NWAGXRLXIXAV0L3DNYY1EPIHNMAAAIZFDFELYSYXL5LFWL1&v=20180605&ll=1.2792655,103.8480938&radius=500&limit=100'"}, "output_type": "execute_result"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "results = requests.get(url).json()\n#results", "execution_count": 25, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# function that extracts the category of the venue\ndef get_category_type(row):\n    try:\n        categories_list = row['categories']\n    except:\n        categories_list = row['venue.categories']\n        \n    if len(categories_list) == 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return categories_list[0]['name']", "execution_count": 26, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "venues = results['response']['groups'][0]['items']\n    \nSGnearby_venues = json_normalize(venues) # flatten JSON\n\n# filter columns\nfiltered_columns = ['venue.name', 'venue.categories', 'venue.location.lat', 'venue.location.lng']\nSGnearby_venues =SGnearby_venues.loc[:, filtered_columns]\n\n# filter the category for each row\nSGnearby_venues['venue.categories'] = SGnearby_venues.apply(get_category_type, axis=1)\n\n# clean columns\nSGnearby_venues.columns = [col.split(\".\")[-1] for col in SGnearby_venues.columns]\n\nSGnearby_venues.head(10)", "execution_count": 27, "outputs": [{"execution_count": 27, "metadata": {}, "data": {"text/html": "<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>name</th>\n      <th>categories</th>\n      <th>lat</th>\n      <th>lng</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Napoleon Food &amp;
